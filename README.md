# Lidar-Map-Reconstruction
Reconstructing Blinded Areas and Eliminating Spike Noise using U-Net Convolutional Neural Network.  

The ability of sensing surrounding terrains plays a crucial part of humanoid robot’s locomotion and trajectory planning. While on-board lidar provides visual images of humanoid robot’s surrounding, there exist two major challenges to rely on such visual images: measurements from on-board lidar contain spike noise, and the humanoid robot’s physical body blinds a significant amount of the on-board lidar’s vision. In order for a machine vision model to reconstruct blinded geometric terrains represented by 2.5D cloud point map and to eliminate spike noise, the model must possess the ability to capture the geometric characteristics of the terrains’ boundaries and then to analyze the patterns without losing the spatial connections. A U-Net, a convolutional network traditionally used for image classification based on spatial characteristics, is re-adjusted to reconstruct the blinded gapes and to eliminate the spike noise.
